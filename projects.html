                <h3>"Summate"</h3>
                <p>"Summate" was a project undertaken in the course "Media Technology and Interaction Design" in the fall semester of 2024.</p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>The project centered around the concept of interdependence in hiking. 
                Using the Double Diamond design framework, we explored logistical challenges faced by hikers, such as preparation and borrowing items. 
                We developed a mobile app prototype aimed at enhancing collaboration and organization among hikers by providing tools like customizable 
                checklists, gear tracking, and shared packing responsibilities.</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>Our team conducted semi-structured interviews with eight hikers to gain insights into hiking behaviors. 
                Feedback from a high-fidelity prototype was collected during usability testing, with users performing tasks and highlighting pain points. 
                We iteratively improved the design based on this feedback through parallel prototyping and continuous refinement.</p>

                <h3>End Product</h3>
                <p>The project resulted in a mobile app prototype featuring a customizable checklist for trip preparation, digital gear inventory tracking, 
                and tools for requesting or borrowing items. It also allowed group collaboration by sharing packing responsibilities, ensuring all needs were met efficiently and seamlessly.</p>

                <h3>AI-generated faces and real faces in gym websites</h3>
                <p>AIG Faces was a project undertaken in the course "Human Perception for Information Technology" in the fall semester 2024.</p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>This project investigated the differences in user perception when gym websites utilized AI-generated faces (AIG) versus real human faces. 
                By embedding both types of faces into a gym website's user interface, the study analyzed how each impacted the perception of three dimensions: wellness, 
                inclusivity, and socialization. Through a combination of quantitative and descriptive analysis, the project provided insights into the nuances of user responses to AIG content in visual design.</p>

                <h3>User Testing</h3>
                <p>A total of 30 participants aged 18-34 from diverse countries were recruited via convenience and snowball sampling. Participants were divided into two groups, 
                each interacting with a survey featuring either real faces or AIG faces. They evaluated website content through Likert-scale questions and open-ended responses focusing on wellness, 
                inclusivity, and socialization. The analysis included statistical testing (Mann-Whitney U) to compare user perceptions.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The study concluded that AI-generated faces could convey wellness and inclusivity on par with real faces. However, real faces were more effective in fostering 
                a sense of social connection and relatability, while AIG faces were perceived as more culturally inclusive. The project highlighted the potential of AIG imagery in 
                design but also emphasized the need for thoughtful application to address limitations like authenticity and emotional resonance.</p>
